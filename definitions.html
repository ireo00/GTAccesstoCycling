                    <h3>Bike Lane</h3>
                    <p>
                      A bike lane is a section of the road that has been specifically marked for the preferred or exclusive use of bicycles through pavement markers, signs, and striping.

                    <h3>Cycle Track</h3>
                    <p>
                     A cycle track is a specialised bicycle facility that blends a segregated path's user experience with a traditional bike lane's on-street infrastructure. A bike lane is different from the sidewalk and physically isolated from motor traffic.

                    <p>
                      Multi-use trails are created with the intention of accommodating various types of users on the same pathway. This requires that the trail is specifically marked for use by cyclists and pedestrians.

                    Sharrows refer to markings painted on a road to indicate that bicycles and cars share the same lane. This is intended to create a shared environment for both types of vehicles.

                    <p>
                    A paved shoulder is a section of a road that is designed to provide space for stopped or emergency vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists. These are typically found on rural roads. The purpose of a paved shoulder is to increase the distance between cyclists and motor vehicles on a roadway that is shared by both, thereby enhancing safety.
