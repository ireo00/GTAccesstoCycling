          <h4><b>Objectives</b></h4>
          <p>
            As cities continue to grow and the number of cars on the roads increases, urban mobility becomes an
            increasingly important issue. Traffic congestion, air pollution, and increased greenhouse gas emissions are
            some challenges posed by this growth in traffic. Active transportation, such as cycling, can be an effective
            solution to these challenges while also promoting physical activity and healthy living. Moreover, the
            COVID-19 pandemic has made cycling more popular, as many people see it as a safer and more socially
            distanced mode of transportation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our project aims to inspire more people to start cycling in the city by developing a web application that
            caters to a diverse audience. We hope to provide a wide range of cycling-related information and resources
            in one location, from introductory safety information to advanced planning tools for current and potential
            cyclists. The focus of our app is the Great Toronto Area (GTA), which is divided into five regions: Toronto,
            Durham, Halton, Peel, and York regions.
